      "term": "P46 Pauline collection",
      "def": "Papyrus codex dated ~175-225 CE containing Romans 1-2 Corinthians Hebrews Ephesians Galatians Philippians Colossians 1 Thessalonians relevant because it proves an early compiled corpus of Paul that can be cross checked for stability"

      "term": "P66 and P75 early Gospels",
      "def": "John and Luke papyri dated ~175-250 CE closely aligned with 4th century codices relevant because early agreement across centuries shows stable transmission"

      "term": "Great Isaiah Scroll 1QIsa a",
      "def": "Near complete Isaiah dated ~125 BCE relevant because it predates Christianity and matches the medieval Masoretic Text which shows long term OT stability"

    {
      "term": "Masoretic stability",
      "def": "Qumran Isaiah aligns closely with Masoretic Text 1008 CE relevant because it demonstrates over 1000 years of consistent copying for the Hebrew Bible"
